docs: Update build documentation to reflect completed prototype

Update all build documentation files to accurately reflect the current
state of the HTML prototype implementation and validated requirements.

Key updates:
- Mark Phase 0 (prototype) as complete with validation checklist
- Update implementation plan with Phase 0 status and key learnings
- Correct file names (resource-list.html vs content-list.html)
- Add My Progress page documentation with charts and statistics
- Document activity flyout functionality and activity types
- Update color scheme documentation (True Lacrosse green palette)
- Add Chart.js integration notes for data visualization
- Document auto-save functionality for reflections
- Update all phase documents (1-6) to align with prototype learnings
- Add backend endpoint for My Progress page
- Enhance content management documentation with categories and slugs
- Update testing requirements to include new features

The documentation now accurately reflects the prototype implementation
and provides a solid foundation for the full-stack development phases.
